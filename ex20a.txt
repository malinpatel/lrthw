US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and
his team have come out fighting after a slew of attacks over his obscene remarks about women.
Mr Trump is due to meet his Democratic rival
Hillary Clinton in the second presidential debate on Sunday night.
His adviser Rudy Giuliani said Mr Trump
may well bring up Mrs Clinton's alleged role in discrediting women who accused her husband Bill of sexual abuse.
A 2005 recording of Mr Trump reveals
him bragging about groping women.
